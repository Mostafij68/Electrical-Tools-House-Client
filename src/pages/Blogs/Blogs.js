                        <li>Use binding functions in constructors.</li>

                    2 What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?
                </div>

                    <p className='text-xl'>
                        There are many ways to manage a state in a React application.
                    </p>
                    <ul className='text-lg font-medium'>
                        <li className='mt-2'>1. Local state :
                            Local state is data we manage in one or another component. Its is declared in function components using useState or useReducer hooks. In React, these hooks are a way of saying, `Hey React, when these values change, re-render.`
                        </li>
                        <li className='mt-3'>2. Global state :
                            When you want to get and update data anywhere in your app, or in multiple components at least, consider global state. A common example of a global state is authenticated user state. If a user is logged into your app, it is necessary to get and change their data throughout your application.
                        </li>
                        <li className='mt-3'>3. Derived state :
                            A simple rule for declaring state: Any state that can be derived, should be derived. For example, if You're storing firstName and lastName in state, You shouldn't store fullName in state. That can be derived! In React, the derived state is accomplished by plain JavaScript.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                3 How does prototypical inheritance work?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p className='text-xl'>
                        Prototypal Inheritance is the process by which one object can be based on another. This lets the objects share each other’s properties. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf.
